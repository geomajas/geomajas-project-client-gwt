 * <p>
 * These controllers can do anything they want with these mouse events, and as a result only one controller can be
 * active on a map at any given time. This is also the difference between controllers and listeners. A
 * <code>Listener</code> passively listens to mouse events without ever interfering with them. Therefore there is no
 * maximum of listeners that can be active on a map at any given time.
