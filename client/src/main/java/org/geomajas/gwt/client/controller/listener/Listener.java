/**
 * <p>
 * Interface for passive listeners on a map. These listeners receive notifications of mouse events on the map, but
 * cannot interfere. That is why they receive a replacement event ({@link ListenerEvent}) instead of the real mouse
 * events.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The difference with a <code>GraphicsController</code> is that controllers can do whatever they want, while a listener
 * is not allowed to interfere with the mouse events in any way. As a result, only one <code>GraphicsController</code>
 * can be active on a map at any given time, while there is no limit to the amount of listeners active on a map.
