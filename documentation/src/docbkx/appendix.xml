        <para>Default zoom behaviour for zooming to a selected point has
        changed: before it was keeping the current scale, now it zooms to the
        maximum scale (by default). The zoom scale for zooming to points can
        be changed on a per-layer level by assigning the
        <code>zoomToPointScale</code> property in
        <code>ClientLayerInfo</code>.</para>

        <para>The smartgwt version has upgraded from 2.5 to 3.1. There is a backwards compatibility issue in smartgwt 
        3.0, see http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwt/release_notes.html#3_0. Although we re-introduced 
        <code>CloseClientEvent</code> as deprecated, you might run into problems with 
        <code>CloseClientHandler</code>.</para>
