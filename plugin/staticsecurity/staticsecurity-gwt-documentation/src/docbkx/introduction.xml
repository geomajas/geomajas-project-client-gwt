	<para>The staticsecurity plugin allows you to define the policies which
		apply for certain users. The policies are statically defined in a XML file
		(hence the name). These policies can be linked to users which can also
		defined in the XML file or which are obtained through code (for example
		linking to a user database or LDAP store).</para>

	<para>This plugin also includes an example which adds a custom policy and
		makes that available in the SecurityContext.</para>
