    <title>GWT widget</title>

    <para>To make it easier for you, the plugin contains a widget which can
    be included in the client GWT.</para>

    <para>This widget consists of a text box where the user can type the
    location string. On pressing <keycode>&lt;enter&gt;</keycode> or
    indicating the search icon, the GetLocationForString command is called.
    When this returns a match, the map will zoom to that area. When the search
    is ambiguous, a pop-up with the alternatives is displayed.<figure>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure></para>

    <para>Including the widget is easy. In the initialization code for your
    application, add in instance of the GeocoderWidget where you want to put
    it. This requires a couple of parameters, the map the widget is connected
    with, the description and label for the widget. In listing <xref
    linkend="createGwtWidget" /> you see an excerpt where the widget in placed
    inside the map's toolbar. The widget tries to adapt itself to the
    currently active locale.</para>
