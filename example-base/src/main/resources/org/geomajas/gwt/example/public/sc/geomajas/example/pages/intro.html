	<p>Welcome to the Geomajas technology showcase. This is the place  for developers and GIS users from governments and businesses to explore the many functionalities of Geomajas.  Here you can try them, test them and evaluate if Geomajas is the technology that can help you build a performing, scalable and cost-effective GIS solution.</p>
	<p>Developers will find a lot more in this showcase since we have made the source code and XML configuration files immediately available.  Those of you that are interested in non-GIS related widget functionalities, please go to the <a href="http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwt/showcase/">SmartGWT showcase page</a>.</p>
	<p>This technology showcase is a work in progress and will be updated with every release so make sure you bookmark this page for future reference. And, if you would find a bug we would be grateful if you report them in the <a href="http://jira.geomajas.org/">Geomajas Issue Tracker</a>.</p>
	<p>Enjoy,</p>
	<p>the Geomajas team.</p>
